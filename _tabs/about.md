Hi, I am Janel James Janiola, and this is my story of how I got into cybersecurity. I was a computer science student ever since when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Because of that, I met my classmates in person for the first time during the last semester of my third year. One of my classmates, Aldwin, introduced me to cybersecurity. From that moment on, I became very interested in the field, especially after he invited me to a conference hosted by "PH CYBER UNITS."

However, I'm still unsure if I should pursue this path in cybersecurity because it was never taught in our college courses. Our curriculum focused more on software development and machine learning. As a result, I took a break from studying cybersecurity for almost four months due to other school priorities.

Then, our OJT (On-the-Job Training) came up. I applied to various companies, but the first to respond was "Trend Micro," a cybersecurity company. Maybe there's a reason for that. Eventually, I became a Global Infrastructure Services Intern there.

I was very happy with my internship because I had great team members and, of course, a skilled manager who trusted me to be their intern. During my nearly 6-month internship, I assisted in service operations and ensured that Trend Micro products and services were stable and available 24/7. I helped monitor items using Site 24/7 and Zabbix, created tools to improve our daily data collection and targets monitoring, and managed patches, assets, configurations, and security for endpoints and servers using Ivanti.

There was an event on November 14, 2023, called DECODE, a major cybersecurity event in the Philippines held every year. Before that, there was the Trend University CTF (Capture The Flag), where universities from all over the Philippines competed, with around 140 teams participating. In the elimination round, we secured the Top 3 spot. This is also when we formed our CTF group at school, named "UnitGG."

As the final round of the CTF approached, we thoroughly reviewed what might come up in the competition. Once the CTF ended, we had to wait almost three days to find out the results. To our delight, UnitGG, representing our university, New Era University, was declared the champion!

Since we became champions, I realized that this might truly be the path for me. Even though I was the newest member of UnitGG, I never lost hope and continued to study diligently. I began preparing for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) from ISC2 and also started reviewing courses from TCM, such as Practical Ethical Hacking, Malware Analysis, and others. However, I haven't fully completed any of these courses yet because I still find some topics challenging. Despite this, I haven't stopped studying, though it can be difficult to juggle multiple reviews at the same time. 

I'm also active on TryHackMe, aiming to achieve the 0xD[GOD] rank and join the top 1% on the platform.


An opportunity came up for us to participate in another CTF, this time an international one, called Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2024, which took place from March 9 to March 14, 2024. Our team ranked 446th out of 5,694 participants—not bad for our team!

I've also been actively participating in seminars about cybersecurity, such as the SANS Community Night. These events have been great opportunities to meet and connect with experts in the field. They generously share advice with beginners like me, helping us navigate and grow in this path.

On April 13, I took the CC exam for the first time. I was nervous even though I had reviewed the material, because, despite reading that this is a beginner certification, I still felt like a complete beginner in this field. Then, I got the results—YEHEY! I passed and earned the certification. It was a free certification, but it still felt incredibly rewarding.

After achieving that, I prepared for our upcoming competition in HackForGov3. Originally, UnitGG consisted of 5 members, but each team in HackForGov needed only 4. So, the team decided to form Team B to represent our school, and I ended up in Team B as the Team Leader. The event was exhilarating because everyone in Team B was participating in HackForGov for the first time, adding pressure on me as the first-time Team Lead of a CTF team.

When the event concluded, UNITGG emerged as the Champion, and the Team B that I led ranked 14th. It was still a joyous occasion, but personally, I felt somewhat saddened because I felt I didn't perform my best under pressure. However, I learned a lot throughout the event, and I'm happy because UNITGG remains our university's team. I just want to add that it was such a joyful experience because we had beautiful uniforms sponsored by GUIDEM and SECUNA. It's so heartwarming knowing that they trusted our university enough to support us in this way.

So much has transpired during my final year as a Computer Science student. It's somewhat regretful that I only began conversing and collaborating with my current teammates late in my academic journey. This was largely due to each of us inhabiting our own worlds from the 1st to the 3rd year, despite being classmates hehe :> . I deeply regret not having had the opportunity to spend those three years with them personally.

I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my parents, who went above and beyond to ensure my completion of studies. College expenses are substantial, and there was a time I almost had to halt my studies due to financial constraints. Thankfully, I secured a full scholarship from Japan, administered locally at UP Diliman. This support was instrumental in enabling me to persevere and complete my college journey. And now, I have reached the culmination of my studies as a Computer Science student.

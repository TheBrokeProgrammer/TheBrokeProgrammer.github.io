# QUESTION 1:

What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

	Because we dont know what other paths here we will use GoBuster, Dirbuster or ffuf to bruteforce the locations

**In this case ill use ffuf

![Alt text](/assets/images/basicpentesting3.png)

	We can see that the hidden path is *development*

# ANSWER 1: development



	Access dev.txt, In this file we know now that we have two Person that names are start with letter K and Letter J

	Access j.txt, In this file we know that there is an important file or anything with the path /etc/shadow
	
![Alt text](/assets/images/basicpentesting6.png)

	Now lets find who they are

### Use brute-forcing to find the username and password

We will used here is enum4linux 

*What is enum4linux?

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. Because we see earlier that there is a Samba Services.

also its because using SMB(Server message block) that's why we use enum4linux

*What is SMB?

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. It can also carry transaction protocols for interprocess communication. Over the years, SMB has been used primarily to connect Windows computers, although most other systems -- such as Linux and macOS -- also include client components for connecting to SMB resources.*

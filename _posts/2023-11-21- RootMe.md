# RootMe

### Recon 
Reconnaissance is crucial for identifying network vulnerabilities, and we use Nmap to efficiently scan and assess these potential security risks.

Upon discovering that port 80 is open, I immediately use FFUF to perform a comprehensive directory and file brute-forcing to uncover hidden web resources.

    The moment I see the /uploads and /panel directory, I recognize a potential vulnerability that we can exploit.

    I exploited the potential vulnerability to attempt a reverse shell, aiming to gain remote access to the server.

    I used the PHP reverse shell script from Pentestmonkey's GitHub repository to try and gain remote access to the server.

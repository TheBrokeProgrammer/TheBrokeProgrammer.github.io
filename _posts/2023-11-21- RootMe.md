### Recon 
Reconnaissance is crucial for identifying network vulnerabilities, and we use Nmap to efficiently scan and assess these potential security risks.

Upon discovering that port 80 is open, I immediately use FFUF to perform a comprehensive directory and file brute-forcing to uncover hidden web resources.

    The moment I see the /uploads and /panel directory, I recognize a potential vulnerability that we can exploit.

I exploited the potential vulnerability to attempt a reverse shell, aiming to gain remote access to the server.

I used the PHP reverse shell script from Pentestmonkey's GitHub repository to try and gain remote access to the server.

Change the ip (attacker ip) and the port (attacker port) and then save it.

First, I attempted to upload the reverse shell file to the /panel directory.

But yea its failed?

But why? Mabye there is a File Type Restriction?

After researching i found this website 
*https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload

I used this file name: php-reverse-shell.php5

And yea it works, you can try different file extension to bypass the restriction, lets check to the the 
/upload directory if its really uploaded

Run listener and click the revshell file

### We get the shell now 

Use this command to find the user.txt

```
find / -type f -name user.txt 2> /dev/null
```

### PrivEsc

Running the command 
```
find / -user root -perm /4000
``` 
searches for files with the setuid (SUID) permission that are owned by the root user.

You should carefully review each file listed and investigate any that seem unusual or unexpected. For instance, files located in non-standard directories, or those that have unusual names or purposes compared to typical system binaries, might warrant closer inspection.

If */usr/bin/python* appears as a file with the SUID permission when you run the command find / -user root -perm /4000, it might raise suspicion because Python interpreter binaries typically don't require the SUID permission.

The SUID permission on a file means that when it's executed, it runs with the privileges of the file's owner (in this case, root). Python scripts are generally run directly by the Python interpreter, which itself does not need elevated privileges to execute Python code.

Becauseeeee of thatttttt we will find this binary in GTFObins, GTFOBins will provide information on potential privilege escalation or security vulnerabilities associated with it.

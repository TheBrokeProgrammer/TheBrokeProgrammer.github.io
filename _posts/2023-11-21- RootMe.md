Upon discovering that port 80 is open, I immediately use FFUF to perform a comprehensive directory and file brute-forcing to uncover hidden web resources.

    The moment I see the /uploads and /panel directory, I recognize a potential vulnerability that we can exploit.

I exploited the potential vulnerability to attempt a reverse shell, aiming to gain remote access to the server.

I used the PHP reverse shell script from Pentestmonkey's GitHub repository to try and gain remote access to the server.

Change the ip (attacker ip) and the port (attacker port) and then save it.

But yea its failed?

But why? Mabye there is a File Type Restriction?
